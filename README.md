# Gantry 5 'Creative Commons (CC) License' Particle for Grav

Particles are small, modular blocks with preset scripting that enable you to add elements to your Grav Gantry 5 pages.

## Installing the Particle

1. Open the folder of your active Gantry theme. For example, if you are using the Hydrogen theme open the folder `/user/themes/g5_hydrogen/`.
2. If a `custom` folder already exists open it, otherwise create it.
3. If a `particles` folder already exists open it, otherwise create it.
4. Upload `cc_license.html.twig` and `cc_license.yaml` files into the `particles` folder. For example, if you are using the Hydrogen theme copy the two particle files into `/user/themes/g5_hydrogen/custom/particles`.
